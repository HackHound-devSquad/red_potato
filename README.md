## The Problem

The number of humans who can be carried to Mars in the early phase will be constrained due to the restricted capacity of spacecraft. As a result, the astronauts who will be residing on Mars will have a heavy burden since they will need to complete a variety of duties in order to support the colony and themselves. With the enormous workload and the small pool of personnel available to complete the duties, distributing the labour will be a difficult challenge. Having a dedicated person to take meal orders won't be possible in such a situation. As a result, it is necessary to investigate other options for the Martian colony's.

## The Solution

We here bring the idea that person entering the restaurant gets to choose the dining area from the given list and then choose to have his favourite place. The place there is equipped with QR codes to access menu. The user will get the current status of dishes available and also get to know about how much time will his order take from now. The menu also suggest the best seller of day and also show user reviews. Then after the person order the food he can wait for the food and by then can have the latest news in the town and enjoy other available joy activities like chess on board and many more. The food is than served and the user is asked to give review of the food and mark a recommendation there. The user will also have his profile on board and can find his food history and decide what to have next at the place.

## Future Scope

- order history recommendations from menu for the user
- preorders for the uers arriving in short while
- giving suggestions for the confued user using AI
